== Data Types - quantity.date_time Package

NOTE: All test data sets for date/time/datetime expressions are represented in the ISO 8601 extended format. An openEHR CDR could choose to use the extended (with field delimiter characters) or basic format (without field delimiters) of ISO 8601, or support any of the two formats. In the test implementations it is probable that the data sets are represented as JSON or XML documents, in which the date and time expressions are always representede in the ISO 8601 extended format, but internally the SUT could store any of the two formats. If the test implementation doesn't use JSON or XML, the date and time expression formats could use the ISO 8601 basic format.

=== DV_DURATION

{openehr_rm_data_types}#_date_time_package[Specification / UML reference^].

NOTE: different duration implementations might affect the DV_DURATION related test cases. For instance, some implementations might not support `days` in the same duration expression that contains `months`, since there is no exact correspondence between the number of `days` and `months` (months could have 28, 29, 30 or 31 days). Then other implementations might simplify the `month` measurement to be 30 days. This also happens with some implementations that consider a `day` is exactly `24 hours` as a simplification. So in case the SUT has an implementation decision to be considered, the developers should mention it in the Conformance Statement Document.

NOTE: the `fractional_seconds_allowed` field is not so clear since the ISO8601 would allow fractions on the lowest order component, which means if the duration lowest component is `minutes` then it's valid to have `5.23M`. Also consider in programming languages like Java, a duration string with fractions on other fields than seconds can't be parsed (for instance using https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-[Java CHarSequence^]).

=== DV_TIME

DV_TIME constraints are defined by C_TIME, which specifies two types of constraints: validity kind and range. The validity kind constraints are expressed in terms of mandatory/optional/prohibited flags for each part of the time expression: minute, second, millisecond and timezone. The range constraint is an Interval<Time>, which are both {openehr_foundation_types}[openEHR Foundation Types^].

NOTE: the Time class mentioned in the AOM specification is actually the {openehr_foundation_types}#_iso8601_date_time_class[Iso8601_date_time^] class. This is a known bug in the specs.

Note that time expressions in openEHR are considered an absolute point in time from the start of the current day, that is `T10` represents `10:00:00.000` AM in the local timezone.

==== Test Case CONT-DV_TIME-validate_open

This case is when DV_TIME matches {*}.

NOTE: the decimal mark for the seconds fraction could be `,` (comma) or `.` (period) at in-memory and storage representations of time expressions, but since in most popular exchange formats the `.` is preferred, and considering the implementation of these test cases will surelly use those exchange formats, we only specify test data sets which use the decimal mark `.`. Nevetheless, the `,` is totally valid at in-memory and storage levels.
In the same line, basic and extended formats are allowed at in-memory and storage representations. Basic format being the time parts without any separators and the extended being the parts with separatos `:` (colon). The extended format is also preferred by the most common exchange fornats, so only test data sets using extended format will be specified.

NOTE: "There is no limit on the number of decimal places for the decimal fraction. However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the communicating parties." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Times[see ISO8601 Times^].

NOTE: the time marker `T` can be ommitted for the extended format in ISO8601:2019, because there is no risk of ambiguity. Since this is nor mandatory, our test data sets all include the `T` time marker.

NOTE: if no timezone information is included, the time expression is considered `local time`.

NOTE: one clarification about the seconds fraction in ISO8601 is that is not exactly an expression of milliseconds as the AOM specification implies considering the `millisecond_validity` fields. For instance `.5` represents half a second, which is indeed 500 milliseconds but `.5` is not syntactically `500 ms`, or `.333333` represents one third of a second, and syntactilclly `333333` goes beyond the precision of milliseconds which is just 3 digits long. Consider `.33333` is totally valid in ISO8601 for the seconds fraction (see NOTE 2).

==== Test Case CONT-DV_TIME-validate_constraint

NOTE: the C_TIME has invariants that define if a higher precision component is optional or prohibited, lower precision components should be optional or prohibited. In other words, if `hour` is optional or prohibited, `minute`, `second` and `millisecond` should be optional or prohibited. These invariants should be checked in an archetype editor and template editor, we consider the following tests to follow those rules without checking them, since that is related to archetype/template validation, not with data validation.

==== Test Case CONT-DV_TIME-validate_range

The C_TIME.range constraint is an Interval<Time>, which are both {openehr_foundation_types}[Foundation Types^].

NOTE: the Time class mentioned in the AOM specification is actually the {openehr_foundation_time_types}[Iso8601_time^] class. This is a {spec_tickets}/SPECPR-380[known bug^] in the specs.

TBD: we need to clarify if T10 is referring to the whole 10th hour or to 10:00:00 omitting the rest of the time components, because it could be a similar case as we have with the date expressions: can only compare expressions that have exactly the same components.

TBD: there is an open question about strictly comparability between time expressions with different components. Is "T10" comparable to "T00:00"?

NOTE: the range with the timezone included doesn't make sense when the time value doesn't have a timezone, since will compare a local time (without TZ) with a global time (with TZ). This case should be considered an error at the archetype level.  Analogously, if the DV_TIME value has a timezome, the C_TIME.range constraints should include the timezone.

=== DV_DATE

DV_DATE constraints are defined by C_DATE, which specifies two types of constraints: validity kind and range. The validity kind constraints are expressed in terms of mandatory/optional/prohibited flags for each part of the date expression: day and month. The range constraint is an Interval<Date>.

NOTE 1: the basic and extended formats are allowed at in-memory and storage representations. Basic format being the time parts without any separators and the extended being the parts with separatos `-` (hyphen). Since most popular exchange formats use the extended format, and considering the implementation of these test cases will surelly use those exchange formats, we only specify test data sets which use the extended format.

NOTE 2: by the ISO8601 standard, only years >1582 are valid, since that was the year in which the Gregorian Calendar was put in place. For representing other years, there should be a mutual agreement between information interchange partners.

NOTE: this is the author's interpretation of a minimal valid date in the context of openEHR noting the description of {openehr_am_aom14}[C_DATE^]: "There is no validity flag for ‘year’, since it must always be by definition mandatory in order to have a sensible date at all.". Though the ISO standard seems to allow partial year expressions.


==== Test Case CONT-DV_DATE-validate_constraint

NOTE: the C_DATE has invariants that define if a higher precision component is optional or prohibited, lower precision components should be optional or prohibited. In other words, if `month` is optional, `day` should be optional or prohibited. These invariants should be checked in an archetype editor and template editor, we consider the following tests to follow those rules without checking them, since that is related to archetype/template validation, not with data validation.

==== Test Case CONT-DV_DATE-validate_range

The C_DATE.range constraint is an Interval<Date>, which are both {openehr_foundation_types}[Foundation Types^].

NOTE: the Date class mentioned in the AOM specification is actually the {openehr_foundation_time_types}[Iso8601_date^] class. This is a {spec_tickets}/SPECPR-380[known bug^] in the specs.

NOTE: the DV_DATE value and the C_DATE.range limits should be comparable, that means the value and range limits should have the same components, for instance a year-only date 2021 can't be compared to a year+month date like 2021-10, because 2021 refers to a whole year, and 2021-10 refers to a month in that year, but it's not possible to say if 2021 < 2021-10 or 2021 2021-10, since both are refering to different things. What we could say is 2020 < 2021, and 2021-10 < 2021-11.


=== DV_DATE_TIME

DV_DATE_TIME constraints are defined by C_DATE_TIME, which specifies two types of constraints: validity kind and range. The validity kind constraints are expressed in terms of mandatory/optional/prohibited flags for each part of the date expression: hour, minute, second, millisecond, timezone, day and month. The range constraint is an Interval<DateTime>.

==== Test Case CONT-DV_DATE_TIME-validate_range

The C_DATE_TIME.range constraint is an Interval<Date_time>, which are both {openehr_foundation_types}[Foundation Types^].

NOTE: the Date_time class mentioned in the AOM specification is actually the {openehr_foundation_time_types}[Iso8601_date_time^] class. This is a {spec_tickets}/SPECPR-380[known bug^] in the specs.

TBD: there is an open question about strictly comparability between time expressions with different components. Is "T10" comparable to "T00:00"?
