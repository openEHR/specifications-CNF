==== Test case DV_PARSABLE value and formalism constrained

Each field of the DV_PARSABLE could be constrained by a C_STRING.

==== Test case DV_MULTIMEDIA media type constraint

NOTE: media_type could be constrained by a C_CODE_PHRASE and size could be constrained by C_INTEGER. A NULL C_CODE_PHRASE for the media_type means any code is allowed from the openEHR media type codeset https://github.com/openEHR/terminology/blob/master/openEHR_RM/openehr_external_terminologies.xml#L399
