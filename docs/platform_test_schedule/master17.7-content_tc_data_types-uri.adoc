==== Test Case CONT-DV_URI-validate_open

On this test case, only invalid URIs should be rejected. Any RFC3986-compliant URI should be accepted.

==== Test Case CONT-DV_URI-validate_pattern

NOTE: to use the pattern constraint, the pattern should comply with the URI format from RFC3986, so the pattern defines a subset of valid URIs. If the pattern doesn't comply with the URI format, modeling tools should be responsible to notify the modeler and shouldn't allow to export archetypes or templates in that case. Testing this is not part of the data validation compliance scope, because it is validation of AOM objects not RM.
