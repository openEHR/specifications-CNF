== Normative Reference

Items in this validation suite conceptually use the following abstract interfaces from the {i_demographic_service_link}[Abstract Platform Service Model, DEMOGRAPHIC component^].

* `I_DEMOGRAPHIC_SERVICE`

These are concretely realised in implementation technology specfic APIs, such as the {openehr_ehr_rest_api}[EHR REST API^].

This test suite uses artefacts defined by the following information model specifications:

* Service Interfaces:
** {openehr_sm_openehr_platform}#_demographic_package[Abstract Demographic Service Model^]
* Information Models:
** {openehr_rm_demographic}[Demographic IM^]
** {openehr_rm_common}[Common IM^]
** {openehr_rm_data_structures}[Data Structures IM^]
** {openehr_rm_data_types}[Data Types IM^]
** {openehr_rm_support}[Support IM^]
** {openehr_rm_common}#_change_control_package[Versioning^]

== Dependencies

This test suite depends on other test suites:

* <<_func_conf_def_adl_component, Functional Conformance: Definitions Component>>, providing OPTs.
