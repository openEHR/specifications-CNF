== Internal LOCATABLE class: OBSERVATION

In this section there are specifications of constraint combinations for OBSERVATION.

Each data set in this section could be combined with the test data sets for COMPOSITION.content defined in section 2.

OBSERVATION data sets:

. OBSERVATION with no state and no protocol
. OBSERVATION with no state and protocol
. OBSERVATION with state and no protocol
. OBSERVATION with state and protocol

NOTE: since data is mandatory by the RM we can’t have a case for an AOM constraint with no OBSERVATION data. Though any OBSERVATION committed to the SUT without data will return a validation error comming from the RM/Schema, and this should be tested.

The constraints combinations described below could be tested in two ways:

. Isolation: by not constraining OBSERVATION.data, OBSERVATION.state and OBSERVATION.protocol, or using the open/'any allowed' constraint \{*} for those attributes.
. Combination: with constraints defined at the HISTORY level (for data and state) and ITEM_STRUCTURE (for protocol).

NOTE: we suggest to test with both strategies.

== Internal LOCATABLE class: HISTORY

In this section there are specifications of constraint combinations for HISTORY, specified in the {openehr_rm_data_structures}#_overview[openEHR Data Structures IM^].

Each data set in this section could be combined with the test data sets for HISTORY defined in section 3.

HISTORY data sets:

. HISTORY with no events and no summary
. HISTORY with events and no summary
. HISTORY with no events and summary
. HISTORY with events and summary

The constraints combinations described below could be tested in two ways:

. Isolation: by not constraining HISTORY.events and HISTORY.summary, or using the open/'any allowed' constraint \{*} for those attributes.
. Combination: with constraints defined at the EVENT level (for events) and ITEM_STRUCTURE (for summary).

NOTE: we suggest to test with both strategies.

== EVENT data sets and test cases

EVENT data sets:

. EVENT with no state
. EVENT with state

NOTE: since data is mandatory by the RM we can’t have a case for an AOM constraint with "`no EVENT.data`". Though any EVENT committed to the SUT without data will return a validation error comming from the RM/Schema, and this should be tested.

EVENT type combinations:

. EVENT is POINT_EVENT
. EVENT is INTERVAL_EVENT

NOTE: testing both EVENT subclasses shouldn’t affect the result of testing combinations with the rest of the constraints defined for EVENT or on container classes. It will affect only the type checking test if the wrong type of EVENT is provided. So instead of combining the expected results with the rest of the constraints, we will define separate test cases.

The constraints combinations described below could be tested in two ways:

. Isolation: by not constraining EVENT.data and EVENT.state, or using the open/'`any allowed`' constraint \{*} for those attributes.
. Combination: with constraints defined at the ITEM_STRUCTURE level (for data and state).

NOTE: we suggest to test with both strategies.

=== TC CONT-EVENT-type_any

== ITEM_STRUCTURE data sets and test cases

ITEM_STRUCTURE type combinations:

. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_TREE
. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_LIST
. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_TABLE
. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_SINGLE

NOTE: testing with any of the ITEM_STRUCTURE subclasses shouldn’t affect the result of testing combinations with the rest of the constraints defined on container classes. It will affect only the type checking test if the wrong type of ITEM_STRUCTURE is provided. So instead of combining the expected results with the rest of the constraints, we will define separate test cases.

=== TC CONT-ITEM_STR-type_any

Description: ITEM_STRUCTURE is any ITEM_STRUCTURE subtype

In the AOM/TOM the constraint for the ITEM_STRUCTURE type is using the abstract class ITEM_STRUCTURE, so it allows any ITEM_STRUCTURE subclass at this position at runtime.
