== Normative Reference
    
Items under this validation suite conceptually use these abstract interfaces defined in the {openehr_sm_openehr_platform}#_definition_package[openEHR Platform Service Model^]:

* {openehr_sm_openehr_platform}#_i_definition_adl2_interface[I_DEFINITION_ADL2^];
* {openehr_sm_openehr_platform}#_i_definition_adl14_interface[I_DEFINITION_ADL14^].

These are concretely realised in implementation technology specfic APIs, such as the {openehr_definitions_rest_api}[Definitions REST API^].

This test suite uses artefacts defined by the following specifications:

* {openehr_am_adl14}[ADL 1.4^]
* {openehr_am_aom14}[AOM 1.4^]
* {openehr_am_adl2}[ADL 2^]
* {openehr_am_aom2}[AOM 2^]
* {openehr_am_id}[Archetype Identification^]

TODO: add ref to dependency diagram in SM/Platform service model.

== Test Environment

The server under test should support:

. OPTs 1.4 or 2, but OPT 1.4 if more frequent since modeling tools supporting this were around for a long time. Could also support ADL, 1.4 or 2;
. validation of OPTs and archetypes uploaded to it, or even provide a service to do so before uploading (useful while developing);
. different versions of the same OPTs and archetypes.

The following should be taken into account when testing any given product:

. The server under test should support the full cycle of OPT management, including: validation, loading, versioning, retrieving, delete or deactivation (data for this OPT is loaded but no new data should be accepted for it). For the delete, the internal behavior should be defined: 1. if data was committed referencing an OPT, can it be physically deleted? or should be logically deleted? 2. if there is no
data, can the OPT be deleted physically? Logical delete might work as the deactivation mentioned above.
. The test cases are the same for OPT 1.4/2, but tests should be written separately and different datasets should be created for 1.4 and 2.
. Different implementations might use specific formats for the template IDs, when testing each server, the template IDs should be adapted to prevent failures for wrong format on the template ID. This is due to openEHR not yet defining a format for the template IDs in the specifications.

NOTE: some servers might not have a way to just validate the OPT, and validation might be part of the OPT upload functionality. In that case, the validation should upload and validate the OPT, and in the cases of valid OPTs, the OPT should be deleted afterwards, so the system state doesnâ€™t change. For invalid OPTs, the upload should fail.

*Implementation note:* when a step says "`for each X, invoke service Y`", means that the test should run completely for each X, that is, the pre-conditions and post-conditions apply to the run for X. So if we have:

Test set: a, b, c 

Test case:

* ensure pre-conditions 
* verify post-conditions 
* flow 
  1. for each X in data set, run service Y
  2. verify result

The run should be:

* ensure pre-conditions
* invoke Y(a)
* verify result
* verify post-conditions
* ensure pre-conditions
* invoke Y(b)
* verify result
* verify post-conditions
* ensure pre-conditions
* invoke Y(c)
* verify result
* verify post-conditions

==== Test Case I_DEFINITION_ADL14.upload_opt-valid_opt_twice_conflict

NOTE: since there is no formal versioning mechanism for templates 1.4 (OPT 2 might use the archetype id format for the template id that also includes a version number, but this is not widely used), the OPT upload service needs to handle a version parameter, for instance this is the solution on the {openehr_definitions_rest_api}#definitions-adl-1.4-template[openEHR REST API^]. If the version information is not available when uploading OPTs, then uploading an OPT with the same `template_id` twice will make the second upload fail (conflict).

An alternative solution for the version parameter is to add the version number to the other_details of the OPT, or directly into the `template_id`.

See: {openehr_jira_home}/browse/SPECBASE-30[SPECBASE-30^] and {openehr_jira_home}/browse/SPECITS-42[SPECITS-42^].

=== Service Model operation: I_DEFINITION_ADL14.delete_opt()

Service Model reference: {i_definition_adl14_link}[`I_DEFINITION_ADL14._delete_opt()_`^]

NOTE: the OPT delete can only happen if there is no associated data with the OPT, or if there exists a newer revision (minor version of the same OPT) in the server under test. For all these tests, there is not data committed to the server, so the delete can happen.

Implementation recommendations: the delete could be logical, so the OPT exists in the server but is not available, and there could be a service to retrieve deleted OPTs. Those can be undeleted or physically deleted (this canâ€™t be undone), and only users with admin permissions should be able to physically delete OPTs.
