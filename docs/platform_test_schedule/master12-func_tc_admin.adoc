== Normative Reference

Items in this validation suite conceptually use the following abstract interfaces from the {i_admin_service_link}[Abstract Platform Service Model, ADMIN component^].

* `I_ADMIN_SERVICE`
* `I_ADMIN_DUMP_LOAD`
* `I_ADMIN_ARCHIVE`

These are concretely realised in implementation technology specfic APIs, such as the {openehr_admin_rest_api}[ADMIN REST API^].

This test suite uses artefacts defined by the following information model specifications:

* Service Interfaces:
** {openehr_sm_openehr_platform}#_admin_package[Abstract Admin Service Model^]
