= Functional Conformance: EHR / COMPOSITION Component

== Normative Reference

Items in this validation suite conceptually use the following abstract interfaces from the {openehr_sm_openehr_platform}#_ehr_package[Abstract Platform Service Model, EHR/COMPOSITION component^].

* `I_EHR_COMPOSITION`

These are concretely realised in implementation technology specfic APIs, such as the {openehr_ehr_rest_api}[EHR REST API^].

The data that flow through these interfaces are defined by the following information model specifications:

* {openehr_rm_ehr}[EHR IM^]
* {openehr_rm_common}[Common IM^]
* {openehr_rm_data_structures}[Data Structures IM^]
* {openehr_rm_data_types}[Data Types IM^]
* {openehr_rm_support}[Support IM^]
* {openehr_rm_common}#_change_control_package[Versioning^]

== Dependencies

This test suite depends on other test suites:

* <<_func_conf_def_component, Functional Conformance: Definitions Component>>, providing OPTs;
* <<_func_conf_ehr_component, Functional Conformance: EHR Component>>, providing EHRs.

== Test Environment

. The server under test should support at least OPTs, 1.4 or 2, but OPT 1.4 if more frequent since modeling tools supporting this were around for a long time. Could also support ADL, 1.4 or 2.
. The server should support at least one of the XML or JSON representations of COMPOSITIONs for committing data, and integrate the corresponding schemas (XML or JSON) to validate data syntactically (before validating against an OPT).

=== Get COMPOSITION latest

*Implementation consideration:*

When a `COMPOSITION` is retrieved from a service, it will comply with a specific format. There could be a variant for each test to retrieve the `COMPOSITION` in any of the supported openEHR formats, and the  syntactic validation of those retrieved formats should be done by using the corresponding schemas (XML, JSON, etc). That would be the minimal validation for conformance testing. Though it would be ideal to have semantic validation of the retrieved `COMPOSITIONs` to ensure conformance, which is achieved by validating against the corresponding OPT in the testing layer.

Notes:

. Current criteria is: only one '`create`' operation is allowed for persistent `COMPOSITIONs`, the next operations over an existing persistent `COMPOSITION` should be '`modifications`'.
. This is under debate in the openEHR SEC since some implementations permit 'persistent' `COMPOSIITONS` to have more than one instance in the same EHR and some others not. This is due to the lack of information in the openEHR specifications. There is also a discussion to define other types of categories for `COMPOSITIONs` to allow different behaviors.

=== Update COMPOSITION

The update `COMPOSITION` service needs the `VERSION.preceding_version_uid` attribute to be set, so the server knows which existing `VERSION` of the `COMPOSITION` will be associated with the newly committed `COMPOSITION`. The Service Model spec is not clear about where that attribute is defined. By taking into account the Reference Model, the `COMPOSITION` doesn’t contain that value but the `VERSION` does. For the `COMPOSITION` update service the `preceding_version_uid` should be a parameter or the definition in the SM should mention this.

NOTE: The common implementation of the `+delete+` operation is two create a new `VERSION` of the `COMPOSITION` that has `VERSION.commit_audit.change_type = openehr::523|deleted|`, and `VERSION.lifecycle_state = openehr::523|deleted|`. So the `+delete+` operation is not a physical delete but a logical delete. Some implementations might add the option of a physical deleted. This test case considers the `+postcondition+` to be a logical delete, which behaves like an `+update+` operation in which a new `VERSION` of an existing `COMPOSITION` is created.
