== 1. Introduction

The test cases defined here are for creating archetypes expressing
specific constraints over the openEHR RM. Then different data instances
should be generated in order to test the constraints. Itâ€™s recommended
to have at least one success case, one failure case and all border cases
covered. That is, for each archetype constraint specified, at least
three data instances should be created.

Since there are many combinations of constraints possible in the
AOM/TOM, we will try to separate them into different classes and focus
on each constraint set class independently from the other sets. The sets
are defined by:

[arabic]
. A top-level LOCATABLE class: COMPOSITION, EHR_STATUS, FOLDER, PARTY.
. Constraint sets on top-level attributes for each class.
. Internal LOCATABLE class: SECTION, ENTRY, HISTORY, ITEM_STRUCTURE, ITEM, DATA_VALUE.
. Constraint sets on internal structures and attributes (at any level in the RM hierarchy in the internal LOCATABLE class).

When checking a "`multiple attribute`" cardinality, this is a good set of combinations to test it:

* 0..*
* 1..*
* 3..*
* 0..1
* 1..1
* 3..5

=== Glossary

* Archetypable class: any class that extends LOCATABLE.
* Archetypable field: generic fields on archetypable classes that can be constrained in archetypes.
* SUT: System Under Test
* RM: openEHR Reference Model
* AOM: Archetype Object Model (model of constraints)
* TOM: Template Object Model (model of constraints from the template 1.4 point of view)

=== Implementation notes

The constraint combinations described in the cases below could be
implemented in different archetypes, or in a generic archetype then
defining the specific constraints at the template level. Which option to
use might depend on the modeling tools used to create archetypes and
templates.

We would suggest to automate the archetype/template test cases
generation instead of creating each constraint combination manualy.

When there is no constraint defined for an attribute, it means anything
is allowed on that attribute. It is recommended to include data not
defined by the archetype, but valid in the RM, when generating the data
instances.

== 2. Top-level LOCATABLE class: COMPOSITION

These cases are defined to verify the constraints defined over
archetypable attributes of the top-level class COMPOSITION.

The constraints combinations described below could be tested in two
ways:

[arabic]
. Isolation: by not constraining the COMPOSITION.content at all, or
adding an open/'`any allowed`' constraint \{*} at the
COMPOSITION.content in the archetype/template. This mean anything, even
nothing, is accepted at the COMPOSITION.content at runtime.
. Combination: with constraints set for COMPOSITION.content, for any
CONTENT_ITEM (SECTION or ENTRY). Below there is a specification of the
constraint combinations for each class accepted at COMPOSITION.content

____
Note: we suggest to test with both strategies.

== 3. Internal LOCATABLE class: OBSERVATION

In this section there are specifications of constraint combinations for
OBSERVATION.

Each data set in this section could be combined with the test data sets
for COMPOSITION.content defined in section 2.

OBSERVATION data sets:

[arabic]
. OBSERVATION with no state and no protocol
. OBSERVATION with no state and protocol
. OBSERVATION with state and no protocol
. OBSERVATION with state and protocol

____
Note: since data is mandatory by the RM we canâ€™t have a case for an AOM
constraint with "`no OBSERVATION.data`". Though any OBSERVATION
committed to the SUT without data will return a validation error comming
from the RM/Schema, and this should be tested.
____

The constraints combinations described below could be tested in two
ways:

[arabic]
. Isolation: by not constraining OBSERVATION.data, OBSERVATION.state and
OBSERVATION.protocol, or using the open/'`any allowed`' constraint \{*}
for those attributes.
. Combination: with constraints defined at the HISTORY level (for data
and state) and ITEM_STRUCTURE (for protocol).

Note: we suggest to test with both strategies.

== 5. EVENT data sets and test cases

EVENT data sets:

[arabic]
. EVENT with no state
. EVENT with state

____
Note: since data is mandatory by the RM we canâ€™t have a case for an AOM
constraint with "`no EVENT.data`". Though any EVENT committed to the SUT
without data will return a validation error comming from the RM/Schema,
and this should be tested.
____

EVENT type combinations:

[arabic]
. EVENT is POINT_EVENT
. EVENT is INTERVAL_EVENT

____
Note: testing both EVENT subclasses shouldnâ€™t affect the result of
testing combinations with the rest of the constraints defined for EVENT
or on container classes. It will affect only the type checking test if
the wrong type of EVENT is provided. So instead of combining the
expected results with the rest of the constraints, we will define
separate test cases.
____

The constraints combinations described below could be tested in two
ways:

[arabic]
. Isolation: by not constraining EVENT.data and EVENT.state, or using
the open/'`any allowed`' constraint \{*} for those attributes.
. Combination: with constraints defined at the ITEM_STRUCTURE level (for
data and state).

____
Note: we suggest to test with both strategies.

=== 5.3. EVENT is EVENT

The title of this case is correct, it means, in the AOM/TOM the
constraint for the EVENT type is using the abstract class EVENT, so it
allows any EVENT subclass at this position at runtime.

[[evt_3]]
[cols="<,,",options="header",]
|===
|event |expected |constraints violated
|POINT_EVENT |accepted |
|INTERVAL_EVENT |accepted |
|===

=== 5.4. EVENT is POINT_EVENT

|===

=== 5.5. EVENT is INTERVAL_EVENT

[[evt_3]]
[cols="<,,",options="header",]
|===
|event |expected |constraints violated
|POINT_EVENT |rejected |Class not allowed
|INTERVAL_EVENT |accepted |
|===

== 6. ITEM_STRUCTURE data sets and test cases

ITEM_STRUCTURE type combinations:

[arabic]
. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_TREE
. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_LIST
. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_TABLE
. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_SINGLE

____
Note: testing with any of the ITEM_STRUCTURE subclasses shouldnâ€™t affect
the result of testing combinations with the rest of the constraints
defined on container classes. It will affect only the type checking test
if the wrong type of ITEM_STRUCTRE is provided. So instead of combining
the expected results with the rest of the constraints, we will define
separate test cases.
____

=== 6.1. ITEM_STRUCTURE is ITEM_STRUCTURE

The title of this case is correct, it means, in the AOM/TOM the
constraint for the ITEM_STRUCTURE type is using the abstract class
ITEM_STRUCTURE, so it allows any ITEM_STRUCTURE subclass at this
position at runtime.
