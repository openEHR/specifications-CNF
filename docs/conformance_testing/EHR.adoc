== EHR Validation Suite

Items under this validation suite conceptually use these abstract
interfaces:

* I_EHR_SERVICE
* I_EHR
* I_EHR_STATUS

Reference:
https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/SM/latest/openehr_platform.html#_openehr_platform_model

=== A. General Requirements

[arabic]
. The server under test should support at least OPTs, 1.4 or 2, but OPT
1.4 if more frequent since there are more modeling tools supporting OPT
1.4.
. The server should support at least the XML representation of
COMPOSITIONs for committing data, since we can use the openEHR XSDs (and
later JSON schemas) to validate those formats. We can’t test, for now,
other formats since we don’t have official tools to validate them.
. The server might be able to validate the internal contents of the
COMPOSITION against the constraints in the correspondent OPT. If the
server supports this, tests for that validation should be designed.

Notes:

* OPT 1.4 is a
https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-XML/latest/components/AM/Release-1.4/[format
specification].
* OPTs 1.4 are derived from
https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/AM/Release-2.0.6/ADL1.4.html[ADL
1.4] archetypes, which are based on the
https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/AM/Release-2.0.6/AOM1.4.html[AOM
1.4].

=== B. EHR Service Test Cases

==== B.1. Create EHR

*Data sets:*

These are the data set classes:

[arabic]
. VALID:
[arabic]
.. not providing and EHR_STATUS (empty input, the server creates the
default structures and data)
.. providing a valid EHR_STATUS
. INVALID:
[arabic]
.. providing invalid EHR_STATUS

*Valid data sets when the EHR_STATUS is provided and internal strucrures
are valid (data set class 1.2):*

[cols=",,,,,",options="header",]
|===
|No. |is_queryable |is_modifiable |subject |other_details |ehr_id
|1 |true |true |provided |not provided |not provided
|2 |true |false |provided |not provided |not provided
|3 |false |true |provided |not provided |not provided
|4 |false |false |provided |not provided |not provided
|5 |true |true |provided |provided |not provided
|6 |true |false |provided |provided |not provided
|7 |false |true |provided |provided |not provided
|8 |false |false |provided |provided |not provided
|9 |true |true |provided |not provided |provided
|10 |true |false |provided |not provided |provided
|11 |false |true |provided |not provided |provided
|12 |false |false |provided |not provided |provided
|13 |true |true |provided |provided |provided
|14 |true |false |provided |provided |provided
|15 |false |true |provided |provided |provided
|16 |false |false |provided |provided |provided
|===

*Any other data set should be treated as invalid, for instance providing
EHR_STATUS with:*

* missing is_queryable, is_modifiable
* empty is_queryable, is_modifiable
* missing or empty subject
* invalid subject
* invalid other_details

*Notes*:

[arabic]
. When the ehr_id is not present, it is expected that it is assigned by
the server.
. The server should set the EHR.system_id value to a known value
(defined by the server’s configuration).
. The default values that should be assigned by the server for
is_modifiable and is_queryable are "`true`", and for the subject it
defaults to an instance of PARTY_SELF.
. There are no cases to check if the provided ehr_id is valid, since in
the
https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/SM/latest/openehr_platform.html#_i_ehr_service_interface[openEHR
Service Model] the parameters is typed to UUID, any other format will be
an invalid call.
. The validity of an EHR_STATUS can be checked in it’s JSON form by
validating against the JSON schemas
https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-JSON/latest/components/RM

===== B.1.a. Main flow: Create new EHR

*Preconditions:*

The server should be empty (no EHRs, no commits, no OPTs).

*Postconditions:*

A new EHR will exist in the system and be consistent with the data sets
used.

*Flow:*

[arabic]
. Invoke the create EHR service

.. for each item in the VALID data set classes
.. when the ehr_id is provided, should be unique for each invocation of
the service
. The server should answer with a positive response associated to the
successful EHR creation

===== B.1.b. Alternative flow 1: Attempt to create same EHR twice

. Invoke the create EHR service
[arabic]
.. for each VALID data set not providing ehr_id
.. for each VALID data set providing ehr_id

successful EHR creation
. Invoke the create EHR service
[arabic]
.. with the same ehr_id of the EHR created in 1.1. (should be read from
the response)

existence of an EHR with the provided ehr_id, because ehr_id values
should be unique

EHR already existing for the provided subject
