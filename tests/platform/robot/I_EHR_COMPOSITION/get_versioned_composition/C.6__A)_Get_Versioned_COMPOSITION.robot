*** Test Cases ***
1. Get Versioned Composition Of Existing EHR (JSON)

    # prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create EHR and commit a composition for versioned composition tests

    get versioned composition of EHR by UID    ${versioned_object_uid}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    200
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${versioned_object_uid}    ${response.body.uid.value}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehr_id}    ${response.body.owner_id.id.value}


2. Get Versioned Composition Of Existing EHR With Two Status Versions (JSON)

    # prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create EHR and commit a composition for versioned composition tests

    update a composition for versioned composition tests

    get versioned composition of EHR by UID    ${versioned_object_uid}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    200
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${versioned_object_uid}    ${response.body.uid.value}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehr_id}    ${response.body.owner_id.id.value}


3. Get Versioned Composition Of Non-Existing EHR (JSON)

    create EHR and commit a composition for versioned composition tests

    create fake EHR

    get versioned composition of EHR by UID    ${versioned_object_uid}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    404


4. Get Versioned Composition Of Invalid EHR_ID (JSON)

    create EHR and commit a composition for versioned composition tests

    Set Test Variable    ${ehr_id}    foobar

    get versioned composition of EHR by UID    ${versioned_object_uid}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    404



5. Get Versioned Composition Of Non-Existing Composition (JSON)

    create EHR and commit a composition for versioned composition tests

    create fake composition

    get versioned composition of EHR by UID    ${versioned_object_uid}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    404


6. Get Versioned Composition Of Invalid Composition ID (JSON)

    create EHR and commit a composition for versioned composition tests

    Set Test Variable    ${versioned_object_uid}    foobar

    get versioned composition of EHR by UID    ${versioned_object_uid}
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    404
