*** Test Cases ***
1. Get Revision History of Versioned Status Of Existing EHR (JSON)
    [Documentation]    Simple test

    prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create new EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    201

    get revision history of versioned ehr_status of EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    200
    ${length} =    Get Length    ${response.body} 	
    Should Be Equal As Integers 	${length} 	1

    ${item1} =    Get From List    ${response.body}    0
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehrstatus_uid}    ${item1.version_id.value}


2. Get Revision History of Versioned Status Of Existing EHR With Two Status Versions (JSON)
    [Documentation]    Testing with two versions, so the result should list two history entries.

    prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create new EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    201

    update EHR: set ehr_status is_queryable    ${TRUE}
    check response of 'update EHR' (JSON)

    get revision history of versioned ehr_status of EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    200
    ${length} =    Get Length    ${response.body} 	
    Should Be Equal As Integers 	${length} 	2

    ${item1} =    Get From List    ${response.body}    0
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehrstatus_uid}    ${item1.version_id.value}

    ${item2} =    Get From List    ${response.body}    1
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehrstatus_uid[0:-1]}2    ${item2.version_id.value}


3. Get Correct Ordered Revision History of Versioned Status Of Existing EHR With Two Status Versions (JSON)
    [Documentation]     Testing with two versions like above, but checking the response more thoroughly.

    prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create new EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    201

    update EHR: set ehr_status is_queryable    ${TRUE}
    check response of 'update EHR' (JSON)

    get revision history of versioned ehr_status of EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    200
    ${length} =    Get Length    ${response.body} 	
    Should Be Equal As Integers 	${length} 	2

    # comment: Attention: the following code is depending on the order of the array!
    ${item1} =    Get From List    ${response.body}    0
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehrstatus_uid}    ${item1.version_id.value}
    # comment: check if change type is "creation"
    ${audit1} =    Get From List    ${item1.audits}    0
    Should Be Equal As Strings    creation    ${audit1.change_type.value}
    # comment: save timestamp to compare later
    ${timestamp1} = 	Convert Date    ${audit1.time_committed.value}    result_format=%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f

    ${item2} =    Get From List    ${response.body}    1
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehrstatus_uid[0:-1]}2    ${item2.version_id.value}
    # comment: check if change type is "modification"
    ${audit2} =    Get From List    ${item2.audits}    0
    Should Be Equal As Strings    modification    ${audit2.change_type.value}
    # comment: save timestamp2, too.
    ${timestamp2} = 	Convert Date    ${audit2.time_committed.value}    result_format=%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f



    # comment: check if this one is newer/bigger/higher than the creation timestamp.
    ${timediff} = 	Subtract Date From Date 	${timestamp2} 	${timestamp1}

    # comment: Idea - newer/higher timestamp - older/lesser timestamp = number larger than 0 IF correct
    Should Be True 	${timediff} > 0


4. Get Revision History of Versioned Status Of Non-Existing EHR (JSON)
    [Documentation]    Simple test

    prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create fake EHR

    get revision history of versioned ehr_status of EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    404
