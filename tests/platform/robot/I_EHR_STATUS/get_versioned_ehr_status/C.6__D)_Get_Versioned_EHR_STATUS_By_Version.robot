*** Test Cases ***
1. Get Versioned Status Of Existing EHR by Version UID (JSON)
    [Documentation]    Simple, valid request

    prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create new EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    201	

    Set Test Variable  ${version_uid}  ${ehrstatus_uid}

    get versioned ehr_status of EHR by version uid
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    200
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${ehrstatus_uid}    ${response.body.uid.value}


1b. Get Versioned Status Of Existing EHR With 2 Versions by Version UID (JSON)
    [Documentation]    Simple, valid request

    prepare new request session    JSON    Prefer=return=representation

    create new EHR
    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.status}    201	

    update EHR: set ehr_status is_queryable    ${TRUE}
    check response of 'update EHR' (JSON)

    Set Test Variable  ${version_uid}  ${ehrstatus_uid[0:-1]}2

    get versioned ehr_status of EHR by version uid
